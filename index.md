## FAQ

- **What's "r/TheMotte"?** A [niche online community of people](https://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/) where rationality & sensibility is incentivized to trump groupthink.
- **How may I add/edit content** or propose any changes? Quicker but not easier approach: [on GitHub](https://github.com/Kuratoro/TheMotte.zettel.page); Easier but with initial learning curve (if you don't know git): editing notes locally using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and synchronizing using [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) (you need a GitHub account for this, and push to your fork; or if you are a mod or an established member do ask for direct repository write access).
    - This site is published using the open source [Emanote](https://note.ema.srid.ca/)
    - This site is like a Wiki but based on [Zettelkasten](https://neuron.zettel.page/zettelkasten) method.
- **Where may I discuss this?** Please open an issue on GitHub.
